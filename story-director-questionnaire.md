# Story Director Questionnaire

## Purpose

This questionnaire is for users who want a **narrative-first** approach to their SUPER-ENTERPRISE game. The Story Director establishes the world, factions, tone, and UI copy BEFORE any coding begins, enabling the Graphics AI to create pixel-accurate mockups and the Architect to lock scope.

**When to use this:**
- You want rich narrative/lore in your game
- You have clear vision for factions, elements, and world-building
- You're doing a SUPER-ENTERPRISE build (three-tier or four-role workflow)
- You want HTML/CSS mockups created before any code

**When to skip this:**
- You're doing SIMPLE or MEDIUM builds (use standard questionnaire instead)
- Your game has minimal narrative (pure mechanics focus)
- You want to jump straight to implementation
