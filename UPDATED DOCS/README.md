# UPDATED DOCS - Six-Role CI/CD System

## Purpose

This folder contains the complete **six-role AI workflow system** for production game development with full CI/CD pipeline, quality gates, and deployment automation.

**Use this system when:**
- You want maximum control over architecture, testing, and deployment
- You need quality gates enforced at every step (PASS/FAIL/WAIVER)
- You want full traceability and evidence for each phase
- You're building a production-deployed game with CI/CD pipeline

**Skip this if:**
- You're doing SIMPLE/MEDIUM builds (use standard questionnaire instead)
- Three-tier workflow is sufficient (Architect, Coder, Graphics)
- You don't need independent QA verification or automated releases

---

## The Six Roles

### 1. üé¨ Story Director (Optional - Narrative-First)
**File:** [STORY_DIRECTOR_ONBOARDING.md](STORY_DIRECTOR_ONBOARDING.md)

**Purpose:** Establish world, factions, tone, and UI copy BEFORE coding

**Outputs:**
- Story Bible (1-2 pages)
- Encounter Palette (JSON)
- Mockup Script (HTML outline)
- Namepack JSON (60+ names)
- Accessibility Notes

**When to use:** Narrative-rich games (RPGs, tactical games with lore)

**When to skip:** Mechanics-focused games (pure action, minimal narrative)

---

### 2. üèõÔ∏è Architect
**File:** [ARCHITECT_ONBOARDING.md](ARCHITECT_ONBOARDING.md)

**Purpose:** Strategic planning, session plans, task creation

**Responsibilities:**
- Create session plans with measurable goals
- Make architectural decisions
- Create detailed task prompts for Coder and Graphics
- Review completion reports
- Enforce quality standards (100% tests, 0 TS errors)

**Does NOT:** Write implementation code, touch codebase

---

### 3. üõ†Ô∏è Coder
**File:** [CODER_ONBOARDING.md](CODER_ONBOARDING.md)

**Purpose:** Tactical implementation, game logic, testing

**Responsibilities:**
- Execute tasks from Architect
- Write clean, tested, type-safe code
- Follow patterns strictly (Result types, deterministic RNG, pure functions)
- Run verification commands (test, type-check, circular deps, build)
- Provide thorough completion reports

**Quality Gates:**
- TypeScript: 0 errors
- Tests: 100% pass rate
- Circular Deps: 0
- Build: Success

---

### 4. üé® Graphics (Two-Phase)
**File:** [GRAPHICS_ONBOARD.md](GRAPHICS_ONBOARD.md)

**Purpose:** Visual polish, sprite integration, UI/UX

**Phase 1 (Mockup-First):**
- Create HTML/CSS mockup (NO JavaScript)
- Integrate sprites and layout
- Verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Provide screenshots for approval

**Phase 2 (Integration):**
- Convert mockup to React components
- Wire animations to game state (read-only)
- Preserve all game logic (NO modifications to src/systems/)
- Test visually + verify no regressions

**Quality Gates:**
- No console errors
- No 404s for assets
- Animations smooth (30+ FPS)
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

---

### 5. üß™ QA/Verifier (Independent Gatekeeper)
**File:** [QA_VERIFIER_ONBOARDER.md](QA_VERIFIER_ONBOARDER.md)

**Purpose:** Independent quality verification BEFORE release

**Inputs:**
- Completion reports from Coder/Graphics
- Acceptance criteria from task prompts
- Quality gate requirements

**Outputs:**
- **PASS** - All gates green, ready to ship
- **FAIL** - Defects found, route back to owner (Coder or Graphics)
- **WAIVER** - Gate failed but acceptable with expiry, requires Architect approval

**Quality Gates (Logic):**
- All tests passing; no flakiness
- TypeScript: 0 errors
- Circular dependencies: 0
- Build: succeeds with no errors
- Determinism honored (same seed ‚Üí same output)

**Quality Gates (Visual):**
- No missing assets / 404s
- Animations smooth (‚âà30+ FPS)
- Aesthetic matches target
- Accessibility: keyboard nav, focus visible, live regions, contrast ‚â• 4.5:1

---

### 6. üöÄ Automation/Release (Orchestrator)
**File:** [AUTOMATION_RELEASE_ONBOARDER.md](AUTOMATION_RELEASE_ONBOARDER.md)

**Purpose:** Packaging, versioning, deployment, handoff routing

**Responsibilities:**
- Watch for QA:PASS signals
- Run packaging/versioning (SemVer)
- Publish releases
- Post "NEXT ACTION" router message to appropriate chat
- Generate release notes

**Baton-Pass Router:**
1. If **Coder** ‚Üí send to **QA** with task prompt + acceptance criteria
2. If **Graphics** ‚Üí send to **QA** with screenshots and a11y checklist
3. If **QA: PASS** ‚Üí package + release; notify Architect, open next task
4. If **QA: FAIL** ‚Üí route back to owner (Coder or Graphics) with defect IDs
5. If **QA: WAIVER** ‚Üí log waiver with expiry; proceed only if Architect approves

**Versioning (SemVer):**
- PATCH (x.y.Z): Bug fixes, balance tweaks
- MINOR (x.Y.0): New features, systems, content
- MAJOR (X.0.0): Breaking changes, full rebalance, major rework

---

## Workflow Orchestration

**File:** [CHAT_ORCHESTRATION_RUNBOOK.md](CHAT_ORCHESTRATION_RUNBOOK.md)

**Purpose:** Copy-paste templates for handoffs between roles

**Operating Rhythm:**

**Phase A ‚Äî Plan (Architect)**
- Output: Session Plan + Task Prompts
- Next: Copy Coder task to Coder chat, visual task to Graphics chat

**Phase B ‚Äî Build (Coder / Graphics in parallel)**
- Output: Completion Reports (logic + visuals)

**Phase C ‚Äî Verify (QA)**
- Input: Both reports + onboarding criteria
- Output: QA Decision Note (PASS/FAIL/WAIVER)

**Phase D ‚Äî Ship (Automation/Release)**
- Input: QA: PASS, build artifacts
- Output: Version, release notes, deployment, status update

**Paste-This Blocks:**
- Architect ‚Üí Coder handoff
- Architect ‚Üí Graphics handoff
- Coder ‚Üí QA handoff
- Graphics ‚Üí QA handoff
- QA ‚Üí Automation handoff

---

2. (Optional) Fill story-director-questionnaire.md if narrative-rich (30-45 min)
3. Create 6 separate AI chats (or 4 if skipping Story + QA/Automation)
4. Give each AI their onboarding doc
5. Follow CHAT_ORCHESTRATION_RUNBOOK.md for handoffs
6. Use PROCESS_GUIDE.md as reference for quality gates

**Time:** 40-60 hours total (30-40x faster than solo)

**Output:** Production-deployed game with full CI/CD pipeline

---

### Option 2: Simplified Four-Role Workflow

**Steps:**
1. Fill story-director-questionnaire.md (if narrative-rich)
2. Use Graphics Onboard for mockup creation (Phase 1)
3. Use Architect for session planning
4. Use Coder + Graphics (Phase 2) for implementation
