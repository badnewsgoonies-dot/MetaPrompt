## üéØ Core Philosophy {#core-philosophy}

### **The Fundamental Principle:**

**Good documentation eliminates prompt complexity.**

A comprehensive onboarding document allows execution prompts to shrink from 150 words to 4-18 words.

### **Why This Works:**

**Traditional Approach:**

User writes long prompt ‚Üí AI asks clarifications ‚Üí 3-6 rounds ‚Üí Variable result
Time: 30-60 minutes of back-and-forth

**Onboarding Approach:**

User creates onboarding doc ‚Üí Uploads doc ‚Üí 4-word prompt ‚Üí Complete result
Time: Immediate execution after initial doc creation

### **The Trade-Off:**

**Upfront Cost:** 1-2 hours creating comprehensive onboarding doc
**Ongoing Benefit:** All future builds use 4-word prompts
**ROI:** Pays off after 2-3 builds, scales infinitely
### **Key Insight:**

The onboarding doc is the REAL prompt. The 4-word execution command just says "run the plan."

---

## üîç Analysis Framework {#analysis-framework}

### **Step 1: Identify the Game/System**

**Questions to ask:**
1. What genre? (Puzzle, Arcade, Shooter, RPG, etc.)
2. What's the core mechanic? (Match blocks, break bricks, dodge obstacles, etc.)
3. What's the win/loss condition?
4. What makes it unique/interesting?
5. What's the scope? (Small prototype vs full game)

**Example: Tetris**
- Genre: Puzzle
- Core Mechanic: Fit falling pieces into rows
- Win: High score | Loss: Board fills
- Unique: Rotation and line clearing
- Scope: Complete arcade game

### **Step 2: Break Into Systems**

**System Definition:**
A system is a cohesive group of related functionality that can be built and tested independently.

**Guidelines:**
- Small games: 3-4 systems
- Medium games: 4-6 systems
- Large games: 6-12+ systems

**System Identification Rules:**

‚úÖ **Good System Boundaries:**
- Can be built in 30-90 minutes
- Has clear inputs/outputs
- Can be tested in isolation
- Has measurable completion criteria

‚ùå **Bad System Boundaries:**
- Too small (10 minutes of work)
- Too large (4+ hours of work)
- Vague scope ("make it fun")
- No clear completion point

### **Step 3: Order Systems by Dependency**

**Build Order Principles:**
1. Core mechanics first (player movement, basic interaction)
2. Then game loop (what makes it a game)
3. Then polish (scoring, effects, UI)
4. Dependencies MUST be explicit

**Example: Breakout**

System 1: Paddle & Ball ‚Üí (foundation)
System 2: Bricks & Collision ‚Üí (depends on System 1)
System 3: Scoring & Lives ‚Üí (depends on System 2)
System 4: Game States ‚Üí (depends on all above)

### **Step 4: Estimate Complexity**

**Complexity Factors:**
- Number of systems (3 = LOW, 6 = MEDIUM, 12+ = HIGH)
- Real-time vs turn-based (real-time = +complexity)
- Entity count (10 entities = simple, 100+ = complex)
- State management (simple FSM vs complex state)
- Integration points (few = simple, many = complex)

**Complexity Categories:**

**LOW (2-4 hours):**
- 3-4 simple systems
- Turn-based or single mechanic
- Minimal state management
- Examples: Flappy Bird, Snake, Pong

**MEDIUM (4-8 hours):**
- 4-6 systems
- Some real-time elements
- Moderate state complexity
- Examples: Tetris, Breakout, 2048

**HIGH (8-20+ hours):**
- 6-12+ systems
- Real-time combat/interaction
- Complex state management
- Multiple entity types
- Examples: Heli-Attack, Tower Defense, Platformers

**ENTERPRISE (40-120+ hours):**
- 12+ interconnected systems
- Production-level architecture
- Comprehensive testing
- Advanced patterns (Result types, etc.)
- Examples: NextEraGame, Full RPGs

## üîß System Breakdown Method {#system-breakdown}

### **How to Identify Systems:**

**Method 1: Player Actions**
List everything the player does, group related actions

**Example: Tetris**
- Actions: Move piece, rotate piece, drop piece, view next piece
- Systems: 
  - System 1: Piece rendering & falling
  - System 2: Player controls
  - System 3: Line clearing
  - System 4: Game states

**Method 2: Game Loop Analysis**
What happens each frame/turn?

**Example: Breakout**
- Each frame: Update paddle, update ball, check collisions, update bricks
- Systems:
  - System 1: Paddle & Ball physics
  - System 2: Brick grid & collision
  - System 3: Scoring
  - System 4: Game states

**Method 3: Entity-Based**

- Systems:
  - System 1: Player entity
  - System 2: Projectiles
  - System 3: Enemies
  - System 4: Collision
  - System 5: Waves
  - System 6: Weapons

### **System Naming Convention:**

- "Enemy AI & Spawning"
- "Collision Detection"
- "Wave Progression System"

**Bad Names:**
- "Main Game Stuff"
- "Everything Else"
- "Gameplay"
- "Core Logic"

### **System Description Format:**

**Purpose:** [One sentence: What this system does and why]

**Measurable Success:**
- [ ] Specific criterion 1 (observable, testable)
- [ ] Specific criterion 2 (observable, testable)
- [ ] Specific criterion 3 (observable, testable)

**Complexity:** [LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH] ([time estimate])
**Files:** [~X files expected]
**Dependencies:** [List other systems this depends on, if any]

**Core Implementation:**
```javascript
// Show the key pattern/algorithm
// 10-30 lines of example code
```
**Why This Approach:**
[1-2 sentences explaining the design choice]

---

## üíª Implementation Pattern Documentation {#implementation-patterns}

### **What Are Implementation Patterns?**

Specific code approaches that solve common problems simply and effectively.

### **How to Identify Patterns:**

**Study successful implementations:**
1. Look at working code examples
2. Identify repeated structures
3. Extract the general pattern
4. Document the "why" not just the "how"

### **Pattern Documentation Template:**

### [Pattern Name]

**When to Use:** [Scenario description]

**Simple Pattern:** [Brief description]

```javascript
// Clean example code (10-30 lines)
// With comments explaining key points
```
**Why This Works:**
- ‚úÖ Reason 1 (benefit)
- ‚úÖ Reason 2 (benefit)
- ‚úÖ Reason 3 (benefit)

**Alternative (Advanced):** [If applicable]
**Skip for prototype:** [Why we use simple version]

### **Common Patterns to Document:**

**Game Loop Patterns:**
- setInterval vs requestAnimationFrame
- Fixed timestep vs variable timestep
- When to use each

**State Management:**
- Simple state machine
- Event-driven updates
- React state patterns

**Collision Detection:**
- AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box)
- Circle collision
- Grid-based collision

**Entity Management:**
- Array-based (push/splice)
- Object pool pattern
- When to use each

**Physics Patterns:**
- Velocity-based movement
- Acceleration/friction
- Angle-based projectiles

**Input Handling:**
- Event listeners
- Key state tracking
- Mouse/touch support

### **Pattern Quality Checklist:**

‚úÖ **Good Pattern Documentation:**
- Shows complete working example
- Explains WHY this approach
- Mentions trade-offs
- Provides alternatives
- Includes real numbers (speeds, sizes)

‚ùå **Bad Pattern Documentation:**
- Just shows code without explanation
- No context for when to use
- Overly complex for prototype
- No working example

---

## üìù Code Example Guidelines {#code-examples}

### **When to Include Code Examples:**

**ALWAYS include code for:**
- Core game mechanics
- Complex algorithms
- Pattern demonstrations
- Data structures

**DON'T include code for:**
- Basic JavaScript syntax
- Standard library usage
- Generic utility functions

### **Code Example Quality Standards:**

**Good Example:**
```javascript
// Ball velocity changes based on where it hits paddle
// Center hit = straight up
// Edge hit = angled bounce
function bounceBallOffPaddle(ball, paddle) {
  // Normalize hit position: -0.5 (left edge) to 0.5 (right edge)
  const hitPosition = (ball.x - paddle.x) / paddle.width - 0.5;

  // Set horizontal velocity based on hit position
  ball.velocityX = hitPosition * ball.speed * 2;

  // Always bounce upward
  ball.velocityY = -Math.abs(ball.velocityY);

  // Normalize to maintain consistent speed
  const currentSpeed = Math.sqrt(
    ball.velocityX ** 2 + ball.velocityY ** 2
  );
  ball.velocityX = (ball.velocityX / currentSpeed) * ball.speed;
  ball.velocityY = (ball.velocityY / currentSpeed) * ball.speed;
}
```

**Why This Is Good:**
- ‚úÖ Comments explain the LOGIC not just the syntax
- ‚úÖ Shows complete working function
- ‚úÖ Real variable names (ball, paddle, not a, b)
- ‚úÖ Explains the math reasoning
- ‚úÖ 10-20 lines (readable length)

**Bad Example:**
```javascript
// Collision detection
function checkCollision(a, b) {
  return a.x < b.x + b.width && 
         a.x + a.width > b.x &&
         a.y < b.y + b.height &&
         a.y + a.height > b.y;
}
```

**Why This Is Bad:**
- ‚ùå No explanation of what a and b are
- ‚ùå Doesn't explain when to use this
- ‚ùå No context about what type of collision
- ‚ùå Generic variable names

### **Code Example Structure:**

**[Pattern Name]:**

[Brief description of what this code does]

```javascript
// High-level comment explaining approach
const CONSTANTS = {
  value1: 10,  // Explain magic numbers
  value2: 5
};

function exampleFunction(param1, param2) {
  // Explain each step with inline comments
  const result = param1 + param2;
  
  // Explain why we do this
  if (result > CONSTANTS.value1) {
    return result * 2;
  }
  
  return result;
}
```
**Why This Works:**
- [Bullet 1: Benefit/reason]
- [Bullet 2: Benefit/reason]

**Key Numbers:**
- value1 = 10 because [reason]
- value2 = 5 because [reason]
```

### **Code Length Guidelines:**

**Simple patterns:** 10-20 lines
**Medium patterns:** 20-40 lines
**Complex patterns:** 40-60 lines
**Never exceed:** 80 lines (break into multiple examples)

## üö´ Anti-Pattern Identification {#anti-patterns}

### **What Are Anti-Patterns?**

Approaches that seem correct but lead to:
- Over-engineering
- Performance issues
- Maintenance nightmares
- Unnecessary complexity

### **How to Identify Anti-Patterns:**

**Ask these questions:**
1. Does this add complexity without benefit?
2. Is there a simpler approach that works?
3. Is this premature optimization?
4. Does this violate "prototype first, perfect later"?
5. Would this slow down iteration speed?

### **Common Anti-Pattern Categories:**

**Over-Engineering:**
```markdown
‚ùå **Don't Use:**
- Physics engines for simple games
- State machines for 2-state games
- Dependency injection for prototypes
- Abstract factories for game objects
- Enterprise patterns in game prototypes

‚úÖ **Do Use:**
- Direct physics calculations
- Simple if/else for state
- Direct instantiation
- Object literals
- Simple, clear patterns
```

**Premature Optimization:**
```markdown
‚ùå **Don't Use:**
- Object pooling before performance issues
- Spatial hashing for <100 entities
- Web workers for simple calculations
- Complex caching systems
- Micro-optimizations

‚úÖ **Do Use:**
- Arrays with splice (simple, works)
- Brute force collision until slow
- Main thread for everything
- Simple lookups
- Readable code first
```

**Feature Creep:**
```markdown
‚ùå **Don't Use:**
- Multiple game modes in MVP
- Extensive customization systems
- Save/load before gameplay works
- Leaderboards before single-player works
- Multiplayer in prototype

‚úÖ **Do Use:**
- Single core mode
- Fixed settings
- Restart button only
- Local high score
- Single player first
```

### **Anti-Pattern Documentation Template:**

## üí° Pro Tips

### **Documentation Philosophy:**

**Write for "you from tomorrow":**
- Assume no memory of this conversation
- Be specific, not clever
- Prefer verbosity over brevity
- Real examples > generic descriptions

**Test your assumptions:**
- Can you copy-paste the code and have it work?
- Can you measure success objectively?
- Would a junior developer understand this?

**Iterate based on results:**
- If execution needed clarification ‚Üí doc was incomplete
- If wrong patterns used ‚Üí anti-patterns insufficient
- If took too long ‚Üí time estimates off
- If bugs ‚Üí success metrics missed edge cases

### **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

‚ùå **Vague System Descriptions**
Bad: "Make the game mechanics work"
Good: "Player paddle moves horizontally, ball bounces off paddle with angle based on hit position"

‚ùå **Missing Code Examples**
Bad: "Use collision detection"
Good: [30 lines of working AABB collision code]

‚ùå **Subjective Success Criteria**
Bad: "Game feels good"
Good: "Controls respond in <50ms, 60 FPS maintained, no console errors"

‚ùå **No Anti-Patterns**
Bad: [Nothing about what NOT to do]
Good: "Don't use physics engine. Use simple velocity math."

‚ùå **No Time Estimates**
Bad: "Implement collision"
Good: "Implement collision (45-60 minutes)"

### **Quality Indicators:**

**Your onboarding doc is GOOD if:**
- ‚úÖ You could hand it off and walk away
- ‚úÖ Every system has example code
- ‚úÖ Success is measurable
- ‚úÖ Anti-patterns prevent mistakes
- ‚úÖ Someone builds it successfully with minimal clarification

**Your onboarding doc needs WORK if:**
- ‚ùå Requires you to answer questions
- ‚ùå Execution AI makes different choices than expected
- ‚ùå Takes significantly longer than estimated
- ‚ùå Results differ from vision
- ‚ùå Multiple clarification rounds needed

## üìã Quick Reference Card

**Creating an Onboarding Doc:**
1. ‚òê Identify 3-12 systems
2. ‚òê Define measurable success per system
3. ‚òê Write code examples for key patterns
4. ‚òê Document anti-patterns (what NOT to do)
5. ‚òê Estimate time per system
6. ‚òê Specify build order
7. ‚òê Add three levels of success metrics
8. ‚òê Include V2 features list
9. ‚òê Run validation checklist

**Each System Must Have:**
- Clear purpose (one sentence)
- Measurable success criteria (3-5 items)
- Code example (10-60 lines)
- Time estimate (realistic)
- Complexity rating

**Code Examples Must Have:**
- Complete working code
- Helpful comments
- Real variable names
- Explanation of "why"

**Success Criteria Must Be:**
- Specific (not vague)
- Measurable (objective)
- Observable (can see it work)
- Testable (quick to verify)

**Remember:**
The onboarding doc is the real prompt. The execution command just says "run the plan."

Good documentation eliminates prompt complexity. ‚ú®
