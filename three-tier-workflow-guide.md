# Three-Tier AI Workflow Guide (+ Optional Story Director)

## Purpose

This document teaches the **SUPER-ENTERPRISE** approach: using three to four specialized AIs in separate chats to build production-grade games.

**Core Three-Tier:** Architect, Coder, Graphics (proven in NextEraGame: 24,500+ lines, 1029+ tests, 99.6% pass rate, 10/10 health score)

**Optional Fourth Role:** Story Director (narrative-first approach, front-loads world-building)

---

## Overview: The Workflow Approaches

### Three-Tier Approach (Core)

> **Architect AI plans ‚Üí Coder AI executes ‚Üí Graphics AI polishes**
>
> All three work in **separate chats** with clear role boundaries.

### Four-Role Approach (Narrative-First)

> **Story Director establishes world ‚Üí Graphics creates mockup ‚Üí Architect plans ‚Üí Coder/Graphics execute**
>
> Front-loads narrative clarity before any code is written.

### Why This Works

**vs Traditional Single-AI Approach:**
- ‚ùå Single AI does strategy + implementation + polish ‚Üí context overload, mixed concerns
- ‚úÖ Three-Four AIs specialize ‚Üí clearer focus, parallel work, better quality

**Benefits:**
- **Specialization** - Each AI focuses on their domain (story, strategy, logic, visuals)
- **Parallel work** - Coder and Graphics can work simultaneously
- **Quality control** - Architect reviews both streams
- **Narrative clarity** - Story Director front-loads world-building (optional)
- **Mockup-first workflow** - Graphics creates HTML/CSS mockups before code (four-role only)
- **Faster iteration** - No strategic debates during coding
- **Better outcomes** - Narrative coherence + strategic planning + reliable execution + professional aesthetics
- **30-40x faster** than solo development

---

## The Four Roles (Story Director Optional)

### üé¨ Story Director AI (Optional - Narrative-First Projects)

**Chat:** Separate chat #0 (Human + Story Director)

**When to Use:**
- Narrative-rich games (RPGs, tactical games with lore)
- You want world-building BEFORE mockups
- Clear faction/element systems
- Complex UI copy and terminology

**When to Skip:**
- Mechanics-focused games (pure action, puzzle)
- SIMPLE or MEDIUM builds
- Minimal narrative requirements

**Responsibilities:**
- Establish world, factions, tone, premise
- Define power systems (elements, statuses, resistances)
- Create naming lexicon (60+ names for units/items/abilities/locations)
- Write UI copy library (buttons, combat text, tooltips)
- Produce encounter palette (difficulty tiers with enemy mixes)
- Create mockup script for Graphics (HTML outline)
- Define accessibility notes (contrast, motion, language)

**Does NOT:**
- Write implementation code
- Create mockups (Graphics does this)
- Make architectural decisions (Architect does this)
- Touch the codebase

**Workflow:**
```
Human fills story-director-questionnaire.md
     ‚Üì
Story Director produces:
  - Story Bible (1-2 pages)
  - Encounter Palette (JSON)
  - Mockup Script (HTML outline)
  - Namepack JSON (60+ names)
  - Accessibility Notes
     ‚Üì
Human hands off to Graphics for mockup creation
     ‚Üì
Graphics creates HTML/CSS mockup (no JS)
     ‚Üì
Human hands off to Architect for planning
```

**Outputs:**
1. **Story Bible** - Premise, factions, power system, lexicon, UI copy
2. **Encounter Palette** - Difficulty tiers with enemy/element/status mixes
3. **Mockup Script** - HTML-ish outline for Graphics (sprites, regions, scales)
4. **Namepack JSON** - Structured names for all game entities
5. **Accessibility Notes** - Contrast hints, motion constraints, language guidance

**Quality Gates:**
- [ ] Story Bible fits on 1-2 pages yet covers world, factions, lexicon, statuses, rewards
- [ ] Encounter Palette defines at least 3 difficulty bands with concrete enemy mixes
- [ ] Mockup Script identifies every sprite region and UI text needed
- [ ] Namepack JSON has 60+ entries across categories
- [ ] Accessibility notes address contrast and motion

**Time Estimate:** 1-2 hours total
- Story Bible: 20-30 min
- Encounter Palette: 10-15 min
- Mockup Script: 10-15 min
- Namepack + Accessibility: 5-10 min

## Session Planning (Architect's Primary Tool)

### Why Session Planning Matters

**Without session plans:**
- ‚ùå Scope creep (features grow uncontrolled)
- ‚ùå Lost direction (forget what success looks like)
- ‚ùå Poor time estimates
- ‚ùå Hard to resume after breaks

**With session plans:**
- ‚úÖ Clear scope boundaries
- ‚úÖ Everyone knows success criteria
- ‚úÖ Easy progress tracking
- ‚úÖ Better time estimates
- ‚úÖ Prevents over-engineering

### Session Plan Template

**Use this before EVERY development session:**

```markdown

[One sentence: What we're accomplishing this session]

## üìä Current State
- Test Count: [X tests passing]
- Coverage: [X%]
- Known Issues: [List any blockers]
- Last Completed: [Previous session's work]

## üéØ Session Goals (Priority Order)

## üéØ Objective
[One sentence: What this function does and why it's needed]

## üì¶ Requirements

### 1. Create Source File
- **File:** src/utils/[filename].ts (NEW file)
- **Function Signature:**
  ```typescript
  export function [functionName]<T>(
    [param1]: [Type1],
    [param2]: [Type2]
  ): [ReturnType]
  ```
- **Implementation:**
  - [Specific requirement 1]
  - [Specific requirement 2]
  - Return [specific value] for [edge case]

### 2. Pattern Requirements
- ‚úÖ Pure function (no mutations, no side effects)
- ‚úÖ Type-safe (proper TypeScript types)
- ‚úÖ Deterministic (if uses RNG, use seeded RNG)
- ‚úÖ Handle edge cases (empty inputs, null, undefined)

### 3. Create Tests
- **File:** tests/utils/[filename].test.ts (NEW file)
- **Required Tests:**
  - Test 1: [Happy path case]
  - Test 2: [Edge case 1]
  - Test 3: [Edge case 2]

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] TypeScript compiles with 0 errors
- [ ] 3+ tests created and passing
- [ ] Function is pure (no mutations)
- [ ] Edge cases handled correctly

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Estimate
5-10 minutes
```

### Template 2: Type Addition/Modification

**Time:** 10-20 minutes
**For:** Adding field(s) to existing type/interface
**Complexity:** MEDIUM
**Risk:** HIGH (breaking change - expect collateral damage)

```markdown
# Task: Add [FieldName] to [TypeName]

## üìã Context
- **Project:** [Your game name]
- **Type File:** src/types/game.ts
- **Owner:** Coder AI
- **IMPORTANT:** This is a breaking change - expect collateral fixes needed

## üéØ Objective
[One sentence: What field you're adding and why]

## üì¶ Requirements

### 1. Update Type Definition
- **File:** src/types/game.ts
- **Location:** [Interface] interface (around line [X])
- **Change:** Add `[fieldName]: [type]` field

git checkout [exact-branch-name-from-task]

# 3. Verify branch state
git status

# 4. Pull latest changes (if applicable)
git pull origin [branch-name]
```

### Step 2: Context Validation
**Verify these dependencies exist:**

```bash
# List expected files
ls -la [path/to/expected/file1.ts]
ls -la [path/to/expected/file2.ts]

# Check for expected code patterns
grep "[expected-pattern]" [file-path]

# Read key files to confirm changes
cat [key-file-path]
```

**Checklist:**
- [ ] All expected files exist

## Tips for Success

### For Humans (Coordinating 3 AIs)

1. **Keep sessions organized:**
   - Use session plans religiously
   - Track which AI is working on what
   - Don't mix strategic/tactical conversations

2. **Copy task prompts exactly:**
   - Copy full task from Architect
   - Paste to appropriate AI (Coder or Graphics)
   - Don't paraphrase or summarize

3. **Copy completion reports back:**
   - Get full report from Coder/Graphics
   - Paste back to Architect for review
   - Let Architect decide next steps

4. **Separate concerns:**
   - Coder never touches visuals
   - Graphics never touches game logic
   - Architect never writes code

5. **Trust the process:**
   - It feels slower at first (3 chats)
   - Becomes MUCH faster with practice
   - Quality is dramatically higher

### For Architect AI

1. **Session plans are mandatory:**
   - Create BEFORE every feature
   - Include clear success criteria
   - List out-of-scope items

2. **Task prompts must be complete:**
   - No ambiguity
   - Specific file paths
   - Exact acceptance criteria
   - Time estimates

3. **Review thoroughly:**
   - Check completion reports
   - Verify quality gates passed
   - Approve or request changes

4. **Prevent scope creep:**
   - Defer non-essential features
   - Stay focused on session goals
   - Say "out of scope" liberally

### For Coder AI

1. **Follow patterns strictly:**
   - Result types for errors
   - Pure functions always
   - Deterministic RNG
   - No mutations

2. **Quality gates are mandatory:**
   - ALL must pass before reporting
   - Fix issues, don't skip
   - 100% test pass rate required

3. **Autonomous recovery:**
   - Type changes break fixtures? Fix them
   - Tests fail? Debug and fix
   - Don't ask permission, just fix

4. **Completion reports must be thorough:**
   - List ALL files changed
   - Show test counts
   - Explain what was done

### For Graphics AI

**Full Reference:** See [graphics-decisions-reference.md](graphics-decisions-reference.md) for complete numeric values and decision rationales.

1. **Visual quality matters:**
   - Match the aesthetic (Golden Sun, neon, etc.)
   - Smooth animations (30+ FPS)
   - No 404s for assets
   - Visual score 9-10/10

2. **Screenshots are required:**
   - Before/after comparisons
   - Show all major changes
   - Prove it works
   - Document visual evidence

3. **Don't touch game logic:**
   - Only visual files (src/components/, src/ui/)
   - Only sprite registry
   - Don't modify systems/ or game logic
   - Leave calculations to Coder AI

4. **Accessibility counts:**
   - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (4.5:1 contrast minimum)
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader support
   - Mobile responsive

5. **Use battle-tested numeric values (from NextEraGame):**
   - Particles: 8-20 per effect (see reference doc)
   - Screen shake: 5px/10px/20px intensity, **300ms fixed duration** (tested in production)
   - Animation timing: 50ms delay ‚Üí 300ms impact ‚Üí 2000ms complete (combat sequence)
   - Flash duration: 150ms suggested (not battle-tested)
   - Entity caps: 200 particles max (SIMPLE), 1500 with pooling (ENTERPRISE)

6. **Risk assessment before starting:**
   - LOW risk (90% success): Particle tuning, screen shake
   - MEDIUM risk (70% success): Animation timing, color palettes
   - HIGH risk (60% success): Sprite integration 100-500 sprites
   - VERY HIGH risk (30-40% success): 1000+ sprites, custom shaders
   - Start with LOW risk tasks, build confidence

7. **Session structure (recommended 50-75 min):**
   - Phase 1: Context (5-10 min) - Screenshots, check console errors
   - Phase 2: Priority (5 min) - Pick 2-3 tasks
   - Phase 3: Implementation (30-45 min) - Execute + test visually
   - Phase 4: Manual Testing (5-10 min) - Play game, verify smooth
   - Phase 5: Documentation (5 min) - Screenshot, report values

8. **Anti-patterns to avoid (Real Failures from NextEraGame):**
   - ‚ùå **Wrong branch:** Always run `git branch --show-current` FIRST
   - ‚ùå **Missing context:** Read existing code before adding (check for duplicates)
   - ‚ùå **Path case sensitivity:** Lowercase folders, PascalCase filenames (Linux != Windows)
   - ‚ùå **CSS overwriting:** Read file before editing, use targeted edits
   - ‚ùå **Registry duplication:** Grep for existing exports before adding
   - ‚ùå **Particle counts >25:** Diminishing returns, causes lag
   - ‚ùå **Screen shake >20px or >300ms:** Motion sickness risk
   - ‚ùå **Low contrast text:** Fails WCAG 2.1 AA (4.5:1 minimum)
   - ‚ùå **Missing screenshots:** Completion reports must have visual evidence
   - ‚ùå **Modifying game logic:** Graphics AI touches ONLY visual files

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Mixing Roles

**Wrong:**
```
Architect: "Add luck stat to PlayerUnit"
[Architect writes the code themselves]
```

**Right:**
```
Architect: Creates task prompt for Coder
Human: Copies task to Coder chat
Coder: Executes task
Human: Copies report to Architect
Architect: Reviews and approves
```

### Pitfall 2: Skipping Session Plans

**Wrong:**
```
Architect: "Build critical hit system"
[No plan, scope creeps, takes 3x longer]
```

**Right:**
```
Architect: Creates session plan
- Goal: Critical hits
- 4 tasks broken down
- 3 hours estimated
- Out of scope listed
[Executes systematically, finishes on time]
```

### Pitfall 3: Incomplete Task Prompts

**Wrong:**
```
Architect: "Add luck stat"
[Coder confused: where? what type? what value?]
```

**Right:**
```
Architect: Uses Template 2
- Exact file: src/types/game.ts
- Exact field: luck: number
- Exact values: 10-30 range
- Exact tests: 3 integration tests
[Coder executes perfectly first time]
```

### Pitfall 4: Forgetting Fresh Session Protocol

**Wrong:**
```
[New chat session]
Coder: Starts coding immediately
[Overwrites prior work, creates conflicts]
```

**Right:**
```
[New chat session]
Task: Uses Template 4 (Fresh Session)
Coder: Checks branch, verifies files, THEN codes
[Clean continuation, no conflicts]
```

### Pitfall 5: Skipping Quality Gates

**Wrong:**
```
Coder: "Done! Here's the code."
[Didn't run tests, 15 tests failing]
```

**Right:**
```
Coder: Implements feature
Coder: Runs type-check (0 errors)
Coder: Runs tests (100% pass)
Coder: Runs circular (0 deps)
Coder: Runs build (success)
Coder: "Done! All quality gates pass."
```
