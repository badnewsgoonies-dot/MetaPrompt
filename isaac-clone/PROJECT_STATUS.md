## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate (Coder)
1. Complete NPC system tests (15+ tests)
2. Implement Movement System (8-directional, collision)

4. Create React components for dialogue box
5. Integrate NPC system with React app

### Near-Term (Next 20-30 hours)
- Complete all 6 core systems (NPC, Movement, Dialogue, Overworld, Shop, Save)
- Write 50+ tests (100% pass rate)
- Verify TypeScript 0 errors
- Manual testing (keyboard navigation, accessibility)

### Later (Graphics Phase 2)
- Convert mockup styles to React components
- Implement animations (idle bobs, walk cycles)
- Polish UI (transitions, fades, sparkles)

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What's Working Well
1. **Six-Role System** - Clear separation of concerns, no scope creep
2. **Mockup-First** - Visual approval before code prevents rework
3. **Story Director** - Comprehensive world-building eliminates ambiguity
4. **Design Tokens** - 60+ CSS variables ensure consistency
5. **Sprite Map JSON** - Data-driven NPC loading (no hardcoding)

### Challenges
1. **Building Sprites** - Using placeholders (authentic sprites needed)
2. **Scope Size** - 35-45 hours estimated (large undertaking)
3. **Existing Codebase** - isaac-clone has Zelda-like systems, need Vale-specific systems alongside

### Decisions Made
1. **Keep Existing Systems** - Don't refactor isaac-clone dungeon systems
2. **Add New Systems** - Vale village systems coexist with existing code
3. **Result Types** - Use existing Result<T,E> pattern for error handling
4. **Pure Functions** - All systems use pure functions (no side effects)
