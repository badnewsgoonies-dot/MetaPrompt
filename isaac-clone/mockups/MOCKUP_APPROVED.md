## Known Issues / Deviations

### Placeholders (By Design)
1. **Building Sprites:** Using CSS placeholders (brown boxes with labels)
   - **Reason:** Actual building sprites not yet sourced
   - **Phase 2 Action:** Replace with authentic Golden Sun building sprites
   
2. **Item Shop Owner Sprite:** Not yet added
   - **Reason:** Sprite not in asset folder
   - **Workaround:** Using generic "Shop Owner" reference

### Intentional Omissions (Out of Scope for MVP)
1. **Interior Screens:** Isaac's house interior, shop interiors, etc.
   - **Reason:** MVP focuses on overworld exploration only
   - **Phase 2+:** Add interior scenes after overworld approved

2. **Shop Menu UI:** No shop interface mockup yet
   - **Reason:** Dialogue system takes priority
   - **Phase 2:** Add shop menu modal

3. **Camera Following:** Scene position fixed, not player-centered
   - **Reason:** No JavaScript in Phase 1 mockups
   - **Phase 2:** Implement JavaScript camera system

4. **Walk Animations:** Only idle bob animation shown
   - **Reason:** Sprite sheets have multi-frame walk cycles
   - **Phase 2:** Implement walk animation on player movement

5. **Hidden NPCs:** 6 NPCs with display:none (Ivan, Mia, Felix, Sheba, Alex, Saturos)
   - **Reason:** Story progression - appear after certain events
   - **Phase 2:** Show/hide based on game state

---

## Design Decisions (Rationale)

### 1. Absolute Positioning vs. Grid System
**Decision:** Absolute positioning with pixel coordinates
**Rationale:** Matches Golden Sun's free-form overworld movement (not tile-locked like Pokémon)
**Phase 2:** Convert to collision-based movement system

### 2. Building Placeholders
**Decision:** CSS boxes instead of waiting for sprites
**Rationale:** Layout and positioning more important than visuals for mockup approval
**Benefit:** Unblock Architect and Coder phases while Graphics sources authentic sprites

### 3. Single Scene (No Camera Scroll Demo)
**Decision:** Fixed camera position showing town center
**Rationale:** No JavaScript in Phase 1 mockups (HTML/CSS only)
**Phase 2:** Implement camera system in React

### 4. Dialogue Box Always Visible (Example State)
**Decision:** Show Garet dialogue as active example
**Rationale:** Demonstrate dialogue layout and styling for approval
**Phase 2:** Hide by default, show on NPC interaction

### 5. 16 Visible NPCs (of 24 total)
**Decision:** Hide story-progression NPCs (display:none)
**Rationale:** 
- Ivan/Mia join party later in game
- Felix/Sheba appear only in prologue
- Alex/Saturos are antagonists (cutscene only)
**Benefit:** Clean MVP scope, demonstrate full cast in sprite_map.json
