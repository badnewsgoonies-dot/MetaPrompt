# Binding of Isaac Clone - Complete Implementation with Balance Fixes

## Summary
Complete implementation of a Binding of Isaac roguelike clone with all requested features and critical balance fixes.

## Features Implemented

### âœ… Core Game Mechanics
- **Player System**: Movement (WASD), shooting (Arrow keys), health system (3 hearts = 6 health)
- **Enemy System**: 3 enemy types (flies, spiders, maws) with distinct AI behaviors
- **Combat System**: Projectile-based collision-based combat
- **Item System**: Power-ups (health up, damage up, speed up, tear rate up)
- **Pickup System**: Hearts, keys, bombs, coins with visual feedback
- **Bomb Mechanics**: Placeable bombs (E key) with explosions that damage enemies and destroy obstacles
- **Obstacle System**: Rocks, spikes, pits, fire, poop (destructible and hazardous types)

### âœ… Roguelike Features
- **Dungeon Generation**: Linear 5-room layout (4 normal + 1 boss)
- **Room Types**: Start, Normal, Boss
- **Door System**: Automatic locking when enemies present, unlocking when cleared
- **Organic Room Transitions**: Player spawns at appropriate edge based on entry direction
- **Procedural Content**: Random enemy spawns, pickup generation, obstacle placement

### âœ… Balance & Polish
- **Invincibility Frames**: 0.3s immunity after taking damage with visual flashing
- **Balanced Damage**: Enemy projectiles do 1 heart (2 damage), player survives 3 hits
- **Fast Combat**: Enemies die in 2-4 hits, responsive and fun
- **Improved Sprites**: Better visibility for obstacles (ðŸ”º spikes, âš« pits)
