# Story Bible: Golden Sun - Vale Village

## Premise
Vale is a peaceful mountain village where the young Adept Isaac begins his journey. When mysterious forces attack Mt. Aleph and unleash ancient Psynergy powers, Isaac must explore his hometown, speak with villagers, and prepare for an epic quest to save Weyard from elemental destruction.

## Loop Framing
Players explore Vale's top-down overworld, interact with NPCs through dialogue boxes, enter buildings (shops, inn, homes), and receive quests that gradually unlock the path to Sol Sanctum and Mt. Aleph. The village serves as a safe hub with healing, equipment, and story progression.
