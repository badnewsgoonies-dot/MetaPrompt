## 🔌 INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

### What Needs to Happen Next

#### 1. Hook Up to Existing Game Code

**Game State Integration:**
```typescript
// In your main game state (wherever that lives)
import { FlagSystem, createFlagSystem } from './systems/storyFlagSystem';
import { DialogueState } from './types/dialogue';
import { QuestState, createQuestSystem } from './systems/questSystem';

interface GameState {
  // ... existing state
  flags: FlagSystem;
  dialogue: DialogueState | null;
  quests: QuestState;
  badges: string[];
}

// Initialize on game start
const flags = createFlagSystem();
const quests = createQuestSystem(flags);
```

**NPC Interaction Hook:**
```typescript
// When player presses E near NPC
import { startDialogue, getCurrentLine } from './systems/dialogueSystem';

function handleNPCInteraction(npcId: string, dialogueId: string) {
  const result = startDialogue(npcId, dialogueId, gameState.flags);
  
  if (result.ok) {
    gameState.dialogue = result.value;
    openDialogueBox(getCurrentLine(result.value));
  }
}
```

**Battle Challenge Integration:**
```typescript
import { hasDialogueAction, getDialogueAction, handleDialogueAction } from './systems/dialogueSystem';

// In dialogue box, check for actions
const actionResult = getDialogueAction(dialogueState);
if (actionResult.ok && actionResult.value?.type === 'battle') {
  const battle Action = actionResult.value;
  // Trigger your battle simulator with battleAction.npcId
  startBattle(battleAction.npcId);
}

// After battle ends
function onBattleEnd(won: boolean, npcId: string) {
  if (won) {
    flags = setFlag(flags, `defeated_${npcId}`, true);
    flags = incrementFlag(flags, 'battles_won', 1);
    checkBadgeProgress();
  }
  // Resume dialogue
}
```

#### 2. Connect to Existing UI

**DialogueBox Component:**
- Already exists at `src/components/DialogueBox.tsx`
- Needs enhancement to show battle options
- Add "⚔️ Battle" button when dialogue offers challenge
- Show choice buttons for branching dialogue

**QuestLog Component:**
- Needs to be created (design provided in architect doc)
- Shows active/completed quests
- Accessible via menu or hotkey
- GBA-style aesthetic

#### 3. Battle Simulator Integration

**Your nexteragame battle simulator should:**
- Accept NPC ID as opponent
- Use NPC's element/stats from character profiles
- Return win/loss result
- Set flags after battle

**Connection Point:**
```typescript
// When dialogue triggers battle
if (action.type === 'battle') {
  const npcId = action.npcId;
  const npc = getNPCData(npcId); // From your sprite registry
  
  // Launch battle simulator
  launchBattle({
    opponent: npc,
    onComplete: (won) => {
      handleBattleEnd(won, npcId);
    }
  });
}
```

#### 4. Save/Load Integration

```typescript
import { saveFlags, loadFlags } from './systems/storyFlagSystem';

function saveGame() {
  saveFlags(gameState.flags);
  // Save other game state...
}

function loadGame() {
  const flagsResult = loadFlags();
  if (flagsResult.ok) {
    gameState.flags = flagsResult.value;
    gameState.quests = createQuestSystem(gameState.flags);
  }
}
```

## 📝 TECHNICAL NOTES

### Architecture Decisions

**Pure Functions:**
- All systems use pure functions that return new state
- No mutations, easy to test
- Predictable behavior

**Result Types:**
- All fallible operations return `Result<T, E>`
- Forces error handling
- Makes bugs visible quickly

**Flag-Based Progression:**
- Everything controlled by flags
- Easy to debug (export flags, check state)
- Save/load is just flag persistence
- Flexible for future expansion

**Data-Driven:**
- Dialogue trees in data files
- Quests in data files
- Easy to add content without code changes
- Modders could extend

### Performance Considerations

**Optimizations Applied:**
- Dialogue trees cached (not reparsed)
- Quest checking only on active quests
- Flag lookups are O(1) hash maps
- No heavy computations in render loop

**Expected Performance:**
- Dialogue: <1ms per interaction
- Quest check: <5ms per frame
- Flag operations: <1ms
- Total overhead: Negligible
