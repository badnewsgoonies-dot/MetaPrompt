3. **mockups/vale-village.html** - Visual mockup (open in browser)

### For Understanding the Plan
1. **artifacts/session-plan.md** - 7 goals, 35-45h estimate, task dependencies
2. **artifacts/acceptance-criteria.md** - 31 measurable requirements
3. **tasks/README.md** - 10 tasks organized with dependencies

2. **src/types/npc.ts** - NPC type definitions (completed)
3. **src/systems/npcSystem.ts** - NPC system implementation (completed)

---

## 🎯 MVP Scope

### ✅ What's Included (MVP)
- **Exploration:** 8-directional movement, collision detection, camera follow
- **NPCs:** 16 unique characters with dialogues
- **Buildings:** 3 enterable (Isaac's house, Item Shop, Armor Shop)
- **Shops:** Buy items with coins (Item Shop: Herbs, Nuts; Armor Shop: Equipment)
- **Save System:** Rest at inn, save to localStorage
- **Accessibility:** Full keyboard navigation, WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

### ❌ What's Not Included (Out of Scope)
- Combat system (no battles)
- Party members (Garet/Ivan/Mia as followers)
- Psynergy abilities (Move, Catch, Lift)
- Equipment stats (can buy but no stat effects)
- World map (Vale village only)
- Sol Sanctum dungeon
- Multiple towns

---

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

**Frontend:**
- React 18
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Vite (build tool)

**Patterns:**
- Pure functions (immutable, no side effects)
- Result<T,E> types (error handling without throws)
- Data-driven (NPCs from JSON, not hardcoded)

**Testing:**
- Vitest (50+ tests required)
- Unit tests (each system)
- Integration tests (systems working together)

**Accessibility:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Full keyboard navigation
- Screen reader support
- 4.5:1 text contrast minimum

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Continue Implementation (Full MVP)
**Estimated:** 25-35 hours

**Tasks Remaining:**
1. Complete NPC tests (15+ tests)
2. Movement system (8-directional + collision)
3. Dialogue system (text rendering + portraits)
4. Overworld system (scene management + transitions)
5. Shop system (buy/sell + inventory)
6. Save system (localStorage persistence)
7. React components (dialogue box, shop menu, UI)
8. Graphics Phase 2 (animations, polish)
9. QA verification (testing + accessibility)
10. Release (build, deploy, documentation)

**Result:** Fully functional Vale village with all features

---

### Option 2: Simplified MVP (Faster)
**Estimated:** 10-15 hours

**Reduce Scope:**
- 16 NPCs → 8 NPCs (major characters only)
- 7 buildings → 1 building (Isaac's house only)
- Skip shop system (exploration + dialogue only)
- Skip save system (session-only gameplay)

**Result:** Playable village with movement + dialogue

---

### Option 3: Review & Adjust
**Time:** 1-2 hours

**Review:**
1. View mockup: `mockups/vale-village.html`
2. Read story bible: `artifacts/story-bible.md`
3. Review acceptance criteria: `artifacts/acceptance-criteria.md`
4. Decide on scope adjustments

**Result:** Clarified requirements, adjusted timeline

## 🎓 How This Was Built

### Six-Role Workflow
1. **Story Director** - World-building, NPCs, dialogue (3 hours)
2. **Graphics (Phase 1)** - HTML/CSS mockup (4 hours)
3. **Architect** - Planning, tasks, criteria (2 hours)
4. **Coder** - Implementation (started, 1 hour so far)
5. **Graphics (Phase 2)** - React integration (pending)
6. **QA** - Verification (pending)
7. **Release** - Build & deploy (pending)

### Why This Approach?
- **Mockup-First:** Visual approval before code (prevents rework)
- **Story-First:** Complete world-building (eliminates ambiguity)
- **Plan-First:** Clear acceptance criteria (everyone aligned)
- **Test-Driven:** 100% test coverage required (quality enforced)
- **Accessible by Default:** WCAG 2.1 AA from day 1
