- **Total Tests:** 200+ tests (from current ~20)
- **Total Files:** 120+ TypeScript files (from current ~50)
- **Total Sprites:** 130+ sprites (from current 30)
- **Total NPCs:** 70+ NPCs (from current 16)
- **Total Locations:** 10+ locations (from current 1)
- **Lines of Code:** 15,000-20,000 LOC

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Estimates

- **Phase 1 (Combat):** 15-20 hours
- **Phase 2 (Sol Sanctum):** 12-15 hours
- **Phase 3 (World Map):** 8-10 hours
- **Phase 4 (New Towns):** 15-20 hours
- **Phase 5 (Advanced Systems):** 10-12 hours
- **Phase 6 (Story):** 8-10 hours
- **Phase 7 (Polish):** 12-15 hours

**Total Estimated Time:** 80-100 hours

**Prompts Across 3 AIs:**
- Architect: 15-20 prompts (planning, review, coordination)
- Coder: 50-70 prompts (implementation, testing)
- Graphics: 20-30 prompts (mockups, sprites, polish)

**Total Prompts:** 85-120 prompts

## üéØ Next Immediate Steps

1. **Architect:** Review and approve this expansion plan
2. **Coder:** Begin Phase 1, Task 1.1 (Combat System)
3. **Graphics:** Create battle screen mockup (Phase 1, Task 1.3)
4. **Parallel Work:** Coder implements combat logic while Graphics creates battle UI mockup
5. **Integration:** Combine logic and visuals after both complete their tasks

---

## üìû Coordination Protocol

**Handoff Between Roles:**
```
Architect creates task prompt
  ‚Üí Human copies to Coder/Graphics chat
  ‚Üí Coder/Graphics executes task
  ‚Üí Coder/Graphics reports completion
  ‚Üí Human copies report back to Architect
  ‚Üí Architect reviews and approves/requests changes
  ‚Üí Repeat for next task
```

**Quality Gate Enforcement:**
- Coder must run `npm run type-check && npm test && npm run build` before every completion report
- Graphics must provide screenshots for every visual task
- Architect rejects incomplete work (no exceptions)

---

**Status:** üéØ **READY TO BEGIN** - Expansion plan complete, awaiting Architect approval

**Created:** 2025-11-01

**Next Milestone:** Complete Phase 1 (Combat System) within 15-20 hours
