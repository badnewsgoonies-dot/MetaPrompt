## üåç WORLD OVERVIEW

### Vale Village - Gateway Between Worlds

Vale is a small, peaceful village nestled in the foothills of Mt. Aleph, the legendary mountain where the power of Alchemy is sealed. For generations, Vale has served as the guardian settlement, with villagers living simple lives while unknowingly standing watch over one of the world's greatest secrets.

**Population:** ~80 inhabitants  
**Founded:** Over 200 years ago by refugees from ancient wars  
**Primary Industries:** Farming, scholarship, blacksmithing  
**Special Status:** Guardian village (unknown to most residents)

### The World Beyond Vale

**Mt. Aleph:** The sacred mountain looming over Vale. Home to Sol Sanctum, an ancient temple where the four Elemental Stars are sealed. Recent earthquakes have villagers worried.

**Weyard:** The greater world, where the power of Alchemy once flowed freely. Centuries ago, Alchemy was sealed away by ancient heroes to prevent catastrophic wars. Now the seal is weakening.

**The Four Elements:** All things in Weyard are connected to the four elements:
- **Venus (Earth):** Strength, growth, stability
- **Mars (Fire):** Passion, courage, destruction  
- **Jupiter (Wind):** Speed, intelligence, freedom
- **Mercury (Water):** Healing, wisdom, adaptation

## üîÆ THE POWER OF ALCHEMY

### What is Alchemy?

Alchemy is the ancient power that flows through Weyard, connecting all living things to the elements. Those born with Alchemical sensitivity can channel **Psynergy** - elemental mental powers that manifest as magic.

**Psynergy Powers Include:**
- Moving objects with the mind (Move)
- Growing plants instantly (Growth)
- Revealing hidden things (Reveal)
- Reading thoughts and emotions (Mind Read)
- Elemental attacks in battle (Ragnarok, Plasma, etc.)

### Adepts - The Chosen Few

**Adepts** are rare individuals born with the ability to channel Psynergy. In Vale, there are only a handful:

- **Isaac** (Venus Adept) - Strong but untrained
- **Garet** (Mars Adept) - Impulsive but loyal
- **Jenna** (Mars Adept) - Passionate and caring
- **Ivan** (Jupiter Adept) - Young, wandering scholar
- **Mia** (Mercury Adept) - Healer from a distant land

Most Adepts don't realize their full potential until awakened by crisis or training.

## üìú VALE'S HISTORY & SECRETS

### The Great Cataclysm (3 Years Ago)

Three years before our story begins, a massive storm struck Mt. Aleph, causing rockslides and earthquakes. The disaster killed several villagers, including:

- **Felix** (Jenna's brother, Isaac's best friend)
- **Isaac's father** (a brave man who tried to save others)
- **Jenna's parents** (caught in the rockslide)

This tragedy bonded the surviving families and left deep emotional scars. Isaac and Jenna grew closer through shared grief. Garet vowed to always protect his friends. The village Elder ordered Sol Sanctum sealed off "for everyone's safety."

### The Hidden Truth

What the villagers DON'T know:
- **Sol Sanctum** contains the four Elemental Stars that seal Alchemy
- The **Elder** and **Kraden** are secret Guardians of this knowledge
- The recent earthquakes are caused by the seal **weakening**
- **Malicious forces** are seeking the Elemental Stars
- If the stars are taken, Alchemy will be unleashed - for good or ill

---

## üé≠ FACTIONS & FORCES

### The Guardians (Good)

**The Elder & Village Council:** Secret keepers who know of Sol Sanctum's true purpose. They maintain the facade of a simple village while watching for threats.

**Kraden the Scholar:** The Elder's advisor and the only living person who has extensively studied Alchemy. He's torn between scientific curiosity and duty to keep Alchemy sealed.

**The Adepts:** Isaac, Garet, and Jenna are unknowingly being prepared as the next generation of Guardians. The Elder has been subtly guiding their development.

### The Seekers (Antagonists - Not Yet Revealed)

**Saturos & Menardi:** Powerful fire Adepts from a distant land. They seek the Elemental Stars to break the seal on Alchemy, believing its release will save their dying homeland. They are desperate, not evil - willing to sacrifice Vale for the greater good.

**Alex:** A mysterious Mercury Adept with hidden motives. He manipulates others to pursue the Elemental Stars for his own purposes - ultimate power.

*(Note: Antagonists won't appear in Vale initially, but their presence will be foreshadowed through strange events and the Elder's warnings.)*

### The People (Neutral)

**Vale Villagers:** Ordinary people living ordinary lives. They know nothing of Alchemy, Psynergy, or the danger lurking on Mt. Aleph. They worry about harvests, relationships, and the recent earthquakes.

---

## üé® TONE & STYLE

### Narrative Tone

**Epic Yet Intimate:** The story deals with world-changing forces (Alchemy, ancient powers), but experienced through the lens of a small village and personal relationships.

**Mystery and Discovery:** Players gradually uncover the truth about Sol Sanctum, Alchemy, and their own powers. Every conversation might contain hidden clues.

**Hopeful Despite Darkness:** Vale has suffered tragedy, but its people remain kind, resilient, and connected. Even in crisis, friendship and courage prevail.

### Dialogue Style

**Authentic & Grounded:** Characters speak naturally but without modern slang. Think fantasy-medieval with warmth.

**Examples:**
- Garet: "Isaac! There you are! Man, did you feel those tremors last night? Shook my whole house!"
- Elder: "Young ones... the time has come for you to know the truth about Sol Sanctum."
- Dora: "Good morning, dear. I made your favorite breakfast. You'll need your strength today."

**Personality Through Dialogue:**
- Major characters have distinct voices and speech patterns
- Minor NPCs have 1-2 personality traits that shine through
- Tutorial dialogue is helpful without being condescending
- Emotional moments are earned through character development

## üí´ CORE THEMES

### 1. Friendship & Loyalty

Isaac, Garet, and Jenna's bond was forged through shared tragedy. They would do anything for each other. This theme extends to all of Vale - it's a community that takes care of its own.

**Story Question:** How far would you go to protect those you love?

### 2. Legacy & Responsibility

The Elder and Kraden carry the burden of ancient knowledge. Isaac and his friends are inheriting this responsibility whether they want it or not.

**Story Question:** What do we owe to the past, and what do we owe to the future?

### 3. Power & Choice

Alchemy is neither good nor evil - it's a tool. The Elemental Stars could save the world or destroy it, depending on who wields them and how.

**Story Question:** Is it better to seal away dangerous power, or trust people to use it wisely?

### 4. Mystery & Truth

Sol Sanctum holds secrets that the Elder has kept hidden for decades. As Isaac uncovers the truth, he must decide who to trust and what to believe.

**Story Question:** Are some secrets worth keeping? What happens when truth conflicts with safety?

### 5. Coming of Age

Isaac begins as an ordinary teenager grieving his father. Through his journey, he'll discover his powers, his purpose, and his courage.

**Story Question:** What does it mean to become a hero?
