# Six-Role Delivery Snapshot – Golden Sun Battle Module

This document captures how the updated battle implementation fulfills each step of the six-role CI/CD workflow.

## 1. Story Director
- Encounter framing: Vale defenders (Isaac, Garet, Ivan, Mia) repel a brigand pack with a Mad Wolf alpha.
- UI copy: command labels, Psynergy descriptions, Djinn names, and victory text embedded in `src/ui/main.ts`.
- Accessibility notes: high-contrast palettes, persistent log, and non-flashing overlays mirrored from the mockups.

## 2. Graphics
- HTML/CSS mockups remain authoritative (`mockup-examples/golden-sun-battle/screens/*`).
- Interactive overlay and HUD styling implemented in `mockup-examples/golden-sun-battle/app/styles.css`.
- Sprite references reuse in-repo assets, maintaining pixel-accurate layout.

## 3. Architect
- Engine exposes `nextRound` stepping for UI orchestration (`src/battle.ts`).
- Player planners (queued) and NPC planners (heuristic) abstract decision making (`src/planners.ts`).
- Browser demo composition documented in `README.md` and consolidated through `tsconfig.build.json`/`package.json` scripts.

## 4. Coder
- `src/ui/main.ts` binds the engine to the interactive HUD, covering command selection, Psynergy/Djinn overlays, targeting, and log rendering.
- Scenario tests extended to validate `nextRound`, queued planners, and AI heuristics (`tests/battle.test.ts`).
- Build output enabled via `npm run build`, emitting ES modules in `dist/` for the demo.

## 5. QA / Verifier
- Automated checks: `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, and `npm run build` must pass prior to release.
- Manual checklist: confirm interactive demo loads, commands execute without console errors, and overlays close correctly.
- Deterministic seed `demo-ui-seed` ensures consistent replay for UI review sessions.

## 6. Automation / Release
- Release artifact: `dist/` bundle ready for static hosting of `mockup-examples/golden-sun-battle/app/`.
- Release notes highlight new UI integration, planner utilities, and extended tests (see PR body).
- Next action prompt: "QA ✅ – ship interactive battle mockup" triggers packaging or integration into the broader Golden Sun project.
