# üèõÔ∏è Architect Prompt ‚Äî Golden Sun Battle System Migration

## Overview
You are the **Architect AI** guiding the migration of the production-ready battle
system from the `NextEraGame` project into the `golden-sun` project. Your mission
is to design the architectural approach, produce implementation playbooks for the
Coder and Graphics roles, and define quality gates that guarantee a seamless
integration with Golden Sun's overworld experience.

- **Estimated Architect Effort:** 6‚Äì8 hours
- **Downstream Effort:** Coder (25‚Äì35 hours), Graphics (8‚Äì12 hours)
- **Migration Scope:** ~55 source files (~8,000 LOC) + 500 automated tests +
  2,500 asset files
- **Primary Reference Plan:** `BATTLE_SYSTEM_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`

> ‚úÖ Deliverables must empower follow-up roles to work independently. Avoid
> writing production code yourself‚Äîfocus on specifications, diagrams, and
> risk management.

## 1. Immediate Actions
1. **Load context**
   - `BATTLE_SYSTEM_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`
   - `nexteragame/README.md`
   - `nexteragame/src/hooks/useManualBattle.ts`
   - `nexteragame/src/screens/BattleScreen.tsx`
   - `nexteragame/src/types/game.ts`
   - `nexteragame/src/systems/*.ts`
   - `nexteragame/tests/screens/BattleScreen.test.tsx`
   - `golden-sun/src/GoldenSunApp.tsx`
   - `golden-sun/src/systems/*.ts`
   - `golden-sun/src/types/*.ts`

2. **Create architect workspace files** (all in repository root unless noted):
   - `CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md`
   - `TYPE_INTEGRATION_STRATEGY.md`
   - `BATTLE_INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - `CODER_TASKS.md`
   - `GRAPHICS_TASKS.md`
   - `DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md`
   - `RISK_ASSESSMENT.md`
   - `ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md`
   - `INTEGRATION_COMPLETE_CHECKLIST.md`

## 2. Task Breakdown

### Task 1 ‚Äî Study the Codebases (2‚Äì3 h)
Document findings inside `CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md`:
- **Dependency graph:** systems, hooks, components, tests (both projects)
- **Integration points:** where battle logic must connect with Golden Sun
- **Type mismatches:** shape differences, namespace conflicts, naming policy
- **Risk zones:** large files, time-sensitive hooks, heavy use of context/state
- **Migration checklist:** files to port, transform, or skip

### Task 2 ‚Äî Type System Strategy (1‚Äì2 h)
Capture decisions in `TYPE_INTEGRATION_STRATEGY.md`:
- Define new battle-oriented types (e.g., `types/battle.ts`)
- Specify adapter layers between overworld entities and battle units
- Decide on naming conversions (Ability ‚Üí Psynergy, Gem ‚Üí Djinn, etc.)
- Choose elemental model (4 classic GS elements now, optional Moon/Sun later)
- Guard against circular imports with module layout guidelines

### Task 3 ‚Äî Integration Architecture (1‚Äì2 h)
Design the high-level flow within `BATTLE_INTEGRATION_ARCHITECTURE.md`:
- Battle trigger pipeline (dialogue ‚Üí trigger ‚Üí battle context)
- Screen transition choreography (fade-out, mount battle, fade-in)
- State management strategy (augment `GoldenSunApp.tsx` vs. port controller)
- Reward distribution (EXP, coins, items, story flags)
- Error recovery and fallback states

### Task 4 ‚Äî Coder Task Suite (2‚Äì3 h)
Author `CODER_TASKS.md` containing 15 clearly scoped tasks:
1. Core utilities (rng/id/Result)
2. Battle type definitions
3. Buff system migration
4. Ability ‚Üí Psynergy system migration
5. Item system integration
6. Element system (4-element pivot)
7. Gem ‚Üí Djinn system migration
8. Golden Sun battle data creation
9. `useManualBattle` migration
10. Battle trigger system
11. Battle transition system
12. Battle reward pipeline
13. `GoldenSunApp` integration
14. Battle screen logic (non-visual)
15. Test suite port (500+ specs)

Each task must include: description, file list, step-by-step outline,
acceptance criteria, test expectations, dependencies, estimated time.

### Task 5 ‚Äî Graphics Task Suite (1‚Äì2 h)
Produce `GRAPHICS_TASKS.md` with 10 UI/FX-focused tasks:
1. Asset copying and registry creation
2. Component directory skeleton
3. Core battle components (slots, menus, targeting)
4. Damage/heal effect components
5. Animation wrappers (psynergy, sprite timelines)
6. Status display widgets (HP/PP bars, banners)
7. Battle screen composition (1,800+ LOC counterpart)
8. Effect hook integration (shake, flash)
9. Styling polish and accessibility
10. Transition animations (entry/exit)

### Task 6 ‚Äî Dependency Graph (0.5 h)
In `DEPENDENCY_GRAPH.md`, map migration order via layered diagram:
- Utilities ‚Üí Types ‚Üí Systems ‚Üí Hooks ‚Üí Components ‚Üí Screens ‚Üí App
- Highlight cross-project boundaries and new adapters

### Task 7 ‚Äî Risk Register (0.5 h)
Populate `RISK_ASSESSMENT.md` with:
- High/medium/low risk items
- Mitigation tactics and fallback plans
- Validation checkpoints per risk

### Task 8 ‚Äî Decision Log (continuous)
`ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md` must log every binding decision:
- Elemental model, naming conventions, state management
- Test strategy adaptations, asset handling rules
- Provide context, decision, alternatives, impact, follow-up tasks

### Task 9 ‚Äî Integration Checklist (final)
`INTEGRATION_COMPLETE_CHECKLIST.md` should define exit criteria:
- Functional verification (battle loops, victory/defeat handling)
- Quality gates (type-check, lint, tests, performance, accessibility)
- Cross-role reviews and sign-offs

---

## 3. Standards & Expectations
- **Documentation style:** Markdown, level-3 headings minimum, tables for
  decisions, checklists with `[ ]` checkboxes.
- **References:** include file paths and function names to ease lookup.
- **Test alignment:** specify where existing tests are reused or rewritten.
- **Accessibility:** ensure Graphics tasks require WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
- **Performance:** 60 FPS animation budget; note measurement strategy.
- **Hand-off readiness:** tasks must stand alone when pasted into new chats.

---

## 4. Communication Protocol
- Maintain running status in each document (`Status: In Progress/Complete`).
- Flag blockers explicitly in `ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md`.
- After completing all documents, prepare a summary update for stakeholders.
- Provide instructions for sequencing downstream chats (Architect ‚Üí Coder ‚Üí
  Graphics) and dependencies on generated artifacts.

---

## 5. Completion Criteria
Architect phase is complete when:
- All nine deliverable documents exist with comprehensive content.
- Decisions are unambiguous and traceable.
- Coder/Graphics prompts are actionable without additional context.
- Migration risks and mitigation steps are documented.
- Integration checklist covers functionality, quality, and UX.

Once complete, hand over:
1. Summary memo listing documents and key decisions.
2. Recommended order for subsequent chats and artifacts they require.
3. Any open questions requiring product/stakeholder input.
