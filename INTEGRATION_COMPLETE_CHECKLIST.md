## 1. Functional Verification
- [ ] Battle can be triggered from dialogue via `battle` action.
- [ ] Battle transitions (enter/exit) play with correct timing and audio swaps.
- [ ] Player party vs enemy battle resolves with victory, defeat, and flee paths.
- [ ] Rewards apply correctly (EXP, items, coins, story flags).
- [ ] Post-battle dialogue resumes (victory + defeat follow-up actions).
- [ ] Overworld resumes with single active RAF loop and restored controls.

## 2. Quality Gates
- [ ] TypeScript passes with `npm run typecheck` (strict mode, 0 errors).
- [ ] Linting passes (`npm run lint` or equivalent).
- [ ] Battle test suite (≥500 specs) passes via `npm test`.
- [ ] Existing overworld tests remain green.
- [ ] Performance profile meets 60 FPS target during battle animations.
- [ ] Accessibility audit passes (axe-core or similar) with WCAG 2.1 AA.

## 3. Visual & Audio Validation
- [ ] All sprites/animations load without missing asset warnings.
- [ ] Screen shake and flash effects use approved intensity (5/10/20px, 300ms).
- [ ] Psynergy and Djinn animations align with lore color palette.
- [ ] Transition overlays honor `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- [ ] Battle UI scales correctly at 1280×720 and 1920×1080.

## 4. Documentation & Handover
- [ ] `ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS.md` updated with any changes made during implementation.
- [ ] `graphics-decisions-reference.md` updated with final animation tweaks.
- [ ] Coder & Graphics deliverables cross-reviewed by QA.
- [ ] Release notes prepared summarizing battle system addition.
- [ ] Follow-up tickets logged for deferred features (e.g., Luna/Sol elements, summon cinematics).
