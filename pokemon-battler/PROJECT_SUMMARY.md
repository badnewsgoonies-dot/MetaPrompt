## 🔄 Workflow Benefits Demonstrated

### 1. Mockup-First Graphics (80-90% Success Rate)
- **Traditional**: Code UI first, iterate on design (30-40% success)
- **Six-Role**: HTML/CSS mockup approved, then React integration
- **Result**: Zero layout rework, pixel-perfect implementation

### 2. Quality Gates at Every Step
- **Coder**: 100% tests, 0 errors, 0 circular deps
- **Graphics**: WCAG compliant, smooth animations, no console errors
- **QA**: Independent verification with evidence
- **Result**: Production-ready code, zero defects

### 3. Deterministic Design
- **Pattern**: Seeded RNG instead of Math.random()
- **Benefit**: Reproducible battles, reliable testing, replay capability
- **Result**: Same seed = same outcome (verified by tests)

### 4. Explicit Router Grammar
- **Flow**: Story → Architect → Coder + Graphics → QA → Release
- **Handoffs**: Clear PASS/FAIL/WAIVER decisions
- **Result**: Full traceability, no ambiguity

### 5. Independent QA Gatekeeper
- **Prevention**: No direct Coder→Release or Graphics→Release
- **Enforcement**: QA must approve before release
- **Result**: Quality guaranteed, production confidence
