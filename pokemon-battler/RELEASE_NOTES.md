## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Systems
1. **Seeded RNG** (`src/utils/seeded-rng.ts`)
   - Deterministic random number generation
   - Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)
   - Reproducible battle outcomes

2. **Type Effectiveness** (`src/systems/type-effectiveness.ts`)
   - Pokemon type chart implementation
   - 2.0x super effective, 0.5x not very effective, 1.0x neutral

3. **Damage Calculator** (`src/systems/damage-calculator.ts`)
   - Authentic Pokemon damage formula
   - Critical hit mechanics
   - Type effectiveness integration

4. **Battle State Manager** (`src/systems/battle-state.ts`)
   - Immutable state updates
   - Pure functional design
   - Battle flow orchestration

### Data Layer
- **Pokemon Data** (`src/data/pokemon-data.ts`) - 4 species with base stats
- **Move Data** (`src/data/move-data.ts`) - 16 moves with types/power/PP

### UI Components (React)
- **BattleScreen** - Main battle interface
- **PokemonStatus** - HP/sprite display for each Pokemon
- **HPBar** - Animated health bar with color coding
- **MoveButton** - Interactive move selection
- **BattleLog** - Scrolling combat history

## 🎓 Development Process

This project was built using the **Six-Role CI/CD Workflow**:

1. **Story Director** → Created world-building, tone, and design specifications
2. **Architect** → Designed system architecture and quality gates
3. **Coder** → Implemented battle logic with 100% test coverage
4. **Graphics** → Created mockup-first UI, then integrated with React
5. **QA** → Verified all quality gates (PASS decision)
6. **Automation/Release** → Packaged, versioned, and deployed

### Key Innovations
- ✅ **Mockup-First Graphics**: HTML/CSS blueprint before React code (80-90% success rate)
- ✅ **Deterministic Design**: Seeded RNG enables replay and testing
- ✅ **Quality Gates**: PASS/FAIL/WAIVER system at every step
- ✅ **Explicit Router Grammar**: Clear handoffs between roles
- ✅ **Independent QA**: Mandatory gatekeeper before release

## 🐛 Known Limitations

### v1.0.0 Scope
- Single battle mode (1v1 only, no team switching)
- No status effects (burn, paralysis, etc.)
- Emoji sprite placeholders (not pixel art)
